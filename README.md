# Quote-Generator
This Quote Generator Web App is a visually appealing and interactive single-page application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate a random motivational or funny quote at the click of a button, displaying both the quote text and the author's name in a clean and stylish layout. The app uses a predefined array of quotes and selects one randomly with each interaction, creating a dynamic and refreshing experience every time. Smooth transition animations enhance the display of each new quote, making the interface feel polished and modern. The design includes vibrant gradient backgrounds, elegant typography, and responsive elements that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring it works beautifully on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This project demonstrates how a simple idea can be transformed into an engaging and user-friendly web application using core front-end technologies, and serves as an excellent introduction to DOM manipulation, styling, and event handling in JavaScript.
